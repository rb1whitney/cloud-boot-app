# Deploy on AWS

Take any application and deploy it to AWS with minimal user decisions.

## Philosophy

**Minimize cognitive burden.** User has code, wants it on AWS. Pick the most
straightforward services. Don't ask questions with obvious answers.

## Workflow

1. **Analyze** - Scan codebase for framework, database, dependencies
2. **Recommend** - Select AWS services, concisely explain rationale
3. **Estimate** - Show monthly cost before proceeding
4. **Generate** - Write IaC code with [security defaults](references/security.md) applied
5. **Deploy** - Run security checks, then execute with user confirmation

## Defaults

See [defaults.md](references/defaults.md) for the complete service selection matrix.

Core principle: Default to **dev-sized** (cost-conscious: small instance sizes, minimal redundancy, and non-HA/single-AZ defaults) unless user says "production-ready".

## MCP Servers

### awsknowledge

Consult for architecture decisions. Use when choosing between AWS services
or validating that a service fits the use case. Helps answer "what's the
right AWS service for X?"

Key topics: `general` for architecture, `amplify_docs` for static sites/SPAs,
`cdk_docs` and `cdk_constructs` for IaC patterns.

### awspricing

Get cost estimates. **Always present costs before generating IaC** so user
can adjust before committing. See [cost-estimation.md](references/cost-estimation.md)
for query patterns.

### awsiac

Consult for IaC best practices. Use when writing CDK/CloudFormation/Terraform
to ensure patterns follow AWS recommendations.

## Principles

- Concisely explain why each service was chosen
- Always show cost estimate before generating code
- Apply [security defaults](references/security.md) automatically (encryption, private subnets, least privilege)
- Run IaC security scans (cfn-nag, checkov) before deployment
- Don't ask "Lambda or Fargate?" - just pick the obvious one
- If genuinely ambiguous, then ask
